I started a To-do list about halfway through this project as I ran into issues while testing other functions. I wanted to include this as well as be able to add to this in case I ran into more issues.

To do
    • N/A

Done
    • pos/neg button
        ◦ if positive, make negative
        ◦ If negative, make positive
        ◦ if NaN, alert
        ◦ How to handle parentheses? 
    • percent button
        ◦ converts number to decimal (10% = 0.1)
        ◦ with x operator, calculates the percent of the number (75 * 10% = 7.5)
        ◦ with / operator, finds the percent of number ( 15 / 60% = 25)
        ◦ with + operator, finds the total plus the percent ( 100 + 7% = 107)
        ◦ with – operator, finds the total minus the percent ( 40 – 25% = 30)
    • decimal button
    • keyboard functionality
        ◦ numbers going in incorrect order
        ◦ map differences between buttons and keyboard
            ▪ delete
            ▪ divide
            ▪ multiply
            ▪ Enter
            ▪ F9
    • number after ) to “ x “ num
    • fix multiple x x
    • add number after = resets and moves answer to hx
    • have hx be empty on clear
    • ( after + adds x incorrectly
    • calculate with open function causes NaN
    • adding number after = shouldn’t append number
    • Backspace button
